In this app, I used Red List data by IUCN for threatened species from 2000 to 2022. 

On the first page the user is first shown a brief introduction and a random portion of the data in general. 

On the second page, an annually graph is shown, separated into the total data assessed and the number of threatened species; the users can select a species of interest via the widget on the left, and modify the color of the graph through the palatte part;  under the graph presents the average number of threatened species from 2000 to 2022 for the selected species. 

In the third page, I divide the data into four categories - vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and fungi and protists - and the users can select one; the right side shows the table of threatened status of the species under the currently selected category; the top of the table presents the change in the selected large category between 2000 and 2022.
